## RandomForests
Imagine you're faced with a complex decision, like choosing a restaurant for a group of friends. Instead of relying on a single person's opinion (decision tree), you decide to ask multiple friends, each with different preferences and experiences (individual trees). Each friend provides a suggestion based on their knowledge (training data). Then, you tally up the votes and go with the most popular choice among your friends (mode of classes in Random Forest). This way, you benefit from diverse perspectives, making the final decision more robust and likely to lead to a satisfying outcome. Just as each friend contributes a different viewpoint, each decision tree in a Random Forest brings its unique insights, leading to a more reliable overall prediction.

Random Forest is an ensemble learning method in machine learning that operates by constructing many decision trees at training time and outputs the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees. It builds multiple decision trees and merges them for a more accurate and stable prediction.
